				<div class="text">
				
    			<p><b>India has an estimated 46 million children between 6-18 years of age who are not in school. Some have never had the chance and many have had to drop out - either to work as child labourers or because they’re being forced to get married.

					YOU can help us change this!
					
					Donate to CRY, India’s most trusted NGO, to make a difference. Your contribution will ensure that such children get a proper education and pave their way to a brighter future.
					
					Help India’s children find their true potential. Donate now!We are advocates of child education, rural development, women empowerment and better rural health and infrastructure.

                    You can take a step forward and donate for child education and support underprivileged children in India.</b></p>
